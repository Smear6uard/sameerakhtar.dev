Your portfolio is already set up to display project screenshots! Follow this guide to add them.

## 🎯 Quick Start

### What You Need:
- Screenshots of your 4 projects
- 10-15 minutes of your time

### Projects to Screenshot:
1. **AI Answer Engine** - https://ai-answer-engine.vercel.app
2. **AI Chrome Extension** - Your Chrome extension in action
3. **Mock Stock Exchange Platform** - Dashboard/interface
4. **Intelligent LLM Router** - Dashboard or results comparison

---

## 📷 Step 1: Take Screenshots

### Recommended Approach:

**For Web Projects** (AI Answer Engine):
1. Open the live project in your browser
2. Use a full-page screenshot tool:
   - **Chrome**: Extensions like "GoFullPage" or "Awesome Screenshot"
   - **Mac**: Cmd + Shift + 5 (can capture specific window)
   - **Windows**: Windows + Shift + S
3. Capture the most impressive view:
   - Homepage with key features visible
   - Results page showing functionality
   - Dashboard with data/metrics

**For Chrome Extension**:
1. Open extension in Chrome
2. Take a screenshot showing:
   - The extension in action on a website
   - The popup/interface
   - The autocomplete feature working

**For Desktop/CLI Projects**:
1. Take a screenshot of:
   - The running application
   - Key interface or terminal output
   - Results or data visualization

### Tips:
- ✅ Use light theme for better contrast (most users view portfolios on light backgrounds)
- ✅ Show real data/results, not placeholder text
- ✅ Capture at least 1200px wide for clarity
- ✅ Make sure UI is clean (close unnecessary tabs/windows in screenshot)
- ❌ Don't include personal info or API keys

## 🖼️ Step 2: Optimize Images

### Option A: Quick Optimization (5 min)

Use an online tool:
1. Go to **https://tinypng.com** or **https://squoosh.app**
2. Upload your screenshots
3. Download optimized versions
4. Target: 100-300KB per image

### Option B: Using Mac Built-in Tool (3 min)

```bash
# Navigate to your screenshots folder
cd ~/Downloads

# Optimize each image (replace filename)
sips -Z 1600 -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 85 screenshot.png --out screenshot.jpg
```

### Target Specs:
- **Width**: 1200-1600px (height will auto-adjust)
- **Format**: JPEG or WebP
- **File Size**: 100-300KB per image
- **Quality**: 85% (good balance of quality/size)

## 📁 Step 3: Add to Your Project

### Save Files:

Save your optimized screenshots to `/public/projects/` with these names:

```
public/projects/
  ├── ai-answer-engine.jpg
  ├── ai-chrome-extension.jpg
  ├── stock-exchange.jpg
  └── llm-router.jpg
```

### Update Code:

Open: `src/components/sections/projects-section.tsx`

Find the `projects` array (around line 11) and update the `image` fields:

```typescript
const projects = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "AI Answer Engine",
    // ... existing fields ...
    image: "/projects/ai-answer-engine.jpg", // ADD THIS LINE
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "AI Chrome Extension",
    // ... existing fields ...
    image: "/projects/ai-chrome-extension.jpg", // ADD THIS LINE
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Mock Stock Exchange Platform",
    // ... existing fields ...
    image: "/projects/stock-exchange.jpg", // ADD THIS LINE
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: "Intelligent LLM Router",
    // ... existing fields ...
    image: "/projects/llm-router.jpg", // ADD THIS LINE
  }
];
```

## ✅ Step 4: Test

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Scroll to Projects section
# Your screenshots should now appear!
```

## 🎨 What It Looks Like

**With Screenshots**:
- Images appear at top of project cards
- Smooth hover effect (zoom on hover)
- Gradient overlay for better text readability
- Professional, portfolio-ready appearance

**Without Screenshots** (current):
- Just gradient backgrounds
- Still looks good, but less impressive
- Text-only doesn't showcase your work visually

## 🚀 Pro Tips

### Make Screenshots More Impressive:

1. **Show Results/Data**
   - Display actual metrics: "98% accuracy", "100+ URLs/hour"
   - Show graphs, charts, or dashboards with data

2. **Highlight Key Features**
   - Use browser dev tools to zoom in on important UI elements
   - Crop to focus on the most impressive parts

3. **Add Context**
   - Show the project "in action" not just a static page
   - For extensions: show them working on a real website
   - For APIs: show results or dashboard

4. **Consistent Style**
   - Try to maintain similar screenshot style across all projects
   - Same aspect ratio (16:9 is good)
   - Similar brightness/contrast

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"My screenshot is too large (>1MB)"**
→ Re-optimize with lower quality (70-80%) or smaller dimensions

**"Screenshot looks blurry"**
→ Make sure original is at least 1200px wide before optimizing

**"Image doesn't show on the site"**
→ Double-check file path and name match exactly (case-sensitive!)
→ Restart dev server after adding images

**"I don't have live versions of my projects"**
→ Run them locally and screenshot
→ Or use design tool (Figma) to create mockups
→ Or describe the project with a diagram instead
